::: {.callout-warning}
GitHub (free account) cannot store large files. If you try to commit and push a large dataset you will have an ERROR! Any file over 100 MB (100,000 KB) needs to be added to the `.gitignore` file BEFORE committing.

**We may need to do that for files in your final project!**

## Data source

For my final project I will be using the [Online News Popularity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/332/online+news+popularity)
